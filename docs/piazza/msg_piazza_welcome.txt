Dear all,



Murakaza neza! Welcome to our class forum! The objective of this platform is for you to be able to ask questions anytime to ourselves or your colleagues, and help each other in the learning process.



Feel free to ask about anything that is confusing! You can chat about homeworks, practicals, class slides, logistics, etc.



Keep in mind that this is not an online chat, so please do not expect an immediate answer from us, as we might be grading, preparing for the next class, or having office hours! We will try to answer your questions as soon as possible, so please be patient :)



In general, we encourage everybody to answer back if they know the answer. Help your colleagues if you can, that is the best way to learn! (and that will definitely count very positively in the grading part called "participation").



Finally, we will ask you to answer to this post introducing yourself one more time, and say something about yourself, to get used to this platform.



We will start: our names are Javier, Weiwei and Melanie, we are researchers located in Boston. Javier likes swimming and yoga, Weiwei loves eating cake and drawing, and Melanie has a rabbit pet called Taiko. We are here to help you in your learning process, so do not hesitate to contact us!

See you in the classroom,

The teaching team
Weiwei, Javier & Melanie
