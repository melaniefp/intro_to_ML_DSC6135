# Introduction to Machine Learning and Computational Statistics -- DSC6135

**University of Rwanda (Master in Data Mining)**

## Course Description

Introduction to ML, probabilistic modeling and data science.
We will cover three major areas in machine learning: supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning.

Our learning approach will be a mixture of conceptual, theoretical, and practical. We will discuss the motivations behind common probabilistic models, and the properties that determine whether or not such models will work well for a particular task. On the one hand, you will derive the mathematical underpinnings for many common ML approaches, as well as apply those techniques to model real data.

## Goals
After this course, you will be able to...

- learn how to think in principled ways of modeling (understand the why's)
- understand deeply how and why machine learning works
- learn how to regularize models
- learn how to optimize objective functions
- learn how to validate
- deal with data computationally large/small, and statistically small.

## Prerequisites

- Python programming.
- Background in stats, and probability (we will review concepts).
- Some linear algebra, multivariate calculus.

Students are expected to write non-trivial programs. Code will be provided in python.


## Course Logistics

This is an intensive course of 4h/day for 10 days in total. Each day will be approximately structured as follows:

* Quizz of concepts/correction of homeworks + summary of previous day and questions (30 min)
* Lecture (1h)
* Practical (30 min)
* Break (15 min)
* Lecture (1h)
* Practical (30 min)
* Introduction to Homework (15 min)


Homeworks will be released/described at the end of class, every two days.
There will be short quizzes at the beginning of each day.


## Requirements and Grading

- (50 pts) 5 mandatory homeworks (every 2 days)
- (30 pts) quizzes
- (15 pts) paper presentation
- (5 pts) participation

Your main deliverable will be homework reports. You’ll be assessed on effort, the sophistication of your technical approach, the clarity of your explanations, the evidence that you present to support your evaluative claims, and the performance of your implementation. A high performing approach with little explanation will receive little credit, while a careful set of experiments that illuminate why a particular direction turned out to be a dead end may
receive close to full credit.


## Philosophy

The goal of this course is to instill a strong technical background for you to responsibly apply machine learning in the world. Thus, in addition to the derivations and the practicals, each class will include a story about real-world applications of machine learning. One full lecture and part of an assignment will be devoted to the ethical implications at the end of the course.

To be blunt: Given the increasing use of machine learning systems, the users and developers of these systems must hold themselves to high professional and ethical standards.
One can cause real harm by pursuing a good cause via poor engineering choices. Quoting one of our favorite superheroes: with great power (to run any kind of analysis)
comes great responsibility (to do it properly)!

Related, we expect all participants in this course—instructors, staff, students—to be
committed to a open, professional, and inclusive environment. Just like the maths, these qualities take cultivation and effort. I will start with the premise that we are all decent people trying our best and encourage constructive feedback to improving the course environment.
