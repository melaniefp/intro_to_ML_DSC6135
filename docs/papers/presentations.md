## Final Presentations

We propose a list of publications on a series of topics for your final presentation.
Choose a paper of your interest and prepare a few slides and a short presentation of 10 min
describing the main ideas of the paper you chose.
**You may prepare and present in pairs**.

The goal is for you to be able to understand and synthesize technical publications in fields
that use machine learning tools.

Read through the following list of proposed topics and publications.
When you are ready and have selected a paper, follow this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nKZckUHjQuO7gbzSwVZdx8NrmyYgqiDgV3Mx8mH2I98/edit?usp=sharing) and write your name
and your partner's next to your choice.
Choosing a paper is a first come, first served assignment; you may not choose a paper
that is no longer available.
