## Ideathon
#### (When: Monday July 1st, 2019)

A “hackathon” is an intense 1 or 2 day event in which those working in tech (e.g. programmer, graphic designers, data scientists) work with domain experts to collaborate on software projects. An “ideathon” is like a hackathon wherein the participants focus on outlining solutions to real-life problems without implementing the solutions. The goal of an ideathon is to produce a concrete plan of action for solving a real-life problem at the end of the event.

**What is a Hackathon?**

A "hackathon" is an intense 1 or 2 day event in which those working in tech (e.g. programmer, graphic designers, data scientists) work with domain experts to collaborate on software projects.
The goal of a hackathon is to create usable software or hardware with the goal of producing a functioning product by the end of the event. Hackathons tend to have a specific focus, for example, on solving a single real-life problem.

**What is this Hackathon about?**
