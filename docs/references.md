## Student Forum - Piazza

Piazza is a free online gathering place where students can ask, answer, and explore 24/7, under the guidance of their instructors. Piazza is a Q&A web service, in between a wiki and a forum.

Please enroll into your class Piazza platform [here](http://piazza.com/university_of_rwanda/summer2019/dsc6135) using the enrolling code: **dsc6135**.

A further note. Although we will monitor this forum every day, don't expect immediate answers to your questions. We may take some time to read your question and answer, so be patient, expect collaboration from your peers, and contribute to this forum yourselves.
